= Lists

== Unordered lists

Use an asterisk, for a bulleted list. To add a title to the list, type the title above the bulleted list and precede with a period.

.Python's animals
* parrot
* snail

Other unordered list styles: use hyphen (-) but with this style you can only create single level lists.

Multi-level unordered list:

.Multi-level unordered list
* level 1
** level 2
*** level 3
** back to level 2
* back to level 1
** new level 2
*** new level 3
* jump back to a level 1

== Ordered lists

Use period space list item to created an ordered list.

.Ordered list
. step 1
. step 2
. step 3

Start order from a specific version:
[start=<number>], for example

[start=4]
. step 4
. step 5

You can also reverse an order:

[%reversed]
. item 3
. item 2
. item 1

Give a title to a list the same ways as in unordered lists.

You can nest items by using more periods.

.Nested ordered list
. step 1
. step 2
.. step 2a
.. step 2b
. step 3

* lowerroman (i. ii. iii.)
* upperalpha (A. B. C.)

== Description lists
A description list, or dlist, is useful to create definition lists or lists with terms and their explanation.

CPU:: The brain of the computer.
RAM:: Random Access Memory, temporary memory for data that the CPU uses during an operation.
Hard drive:: Permanent storage ofr operating system and user files.

To show term and description horizontally, add [horizontal] above the dlist.

[horizontal]
CPU:: The brain of the computer.
RAM:: Random Access Memory, temporary memory for data that the CPU uses during an operation.
Hard drive:: Permanent storage ofr operating system and user files.

A description list can be any AsciiDoc element
