= Links and images

== External links
Add the URL (http, https, ftp, irc, mailto and email addresses).

Example: https://asciidoctor.org or thomas@sheetconsultancy.be

If you want to omit the used URI scheme, add the hide-uri-scheme in the document's header.

:hide-uri-scheme:
https://asciidoctor.org

To add a link to text, add the URL and append the show text between square brackets: +
In the https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoc documentation], you find everything you need to know to write in asciidoc.

If a link is not detected by the parser, use the link macro: +
link:https://sheetconsultancy.be[Sheet Consultancy]

To open a link in a new tab, use show text and end the text with the caret (^) or with "window=_blank". +
Example: https://sheetconsultancy.be[Sheet Consultancy^] or https://sheetconsultancy.be[Sheet Consultancy,window=_blank]

== Links to relative files
Use the link macro to link to an external file, relative to the current document.

link:../../../../readme.adoc[Open the readme.adoc file.]

== Cross references
Use double angled brackets around the ID of a target block or section. The target can also be the path to another document with an optional anchor.

The section <<External links,External links>> describes how you can create external links in asciidoc.

You can also use the internal xref macro.

Link to file relative to current document: +
xref:004-lists.adoc[]

== Images

----
image::<image>[]
----

Optionally, add alt-text between the square brackets.

Add id, title (aka caption), set dimensions and make it a link:

.Toast met Cambozola
[#toast-plate,link=https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipN4izHisN0nlnO7XyimbFAYWEmQpJNIXmL4iddY,300,200]
image::toast-cambozola.jpg[300,200]

.Another food image
image::food.jpg[More food,300,200]

To add an inline image, for example to add an icon in a sentence, use the image macro (image:)
